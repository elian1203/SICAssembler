Pass 1 check for plus, if yes then locationcounter += 4
Check the format to see how many bytes to add to counter
- If 3/4 then 3
- This is only if there's no plus sign
Try creating a lot of booleans
Store location counter in a struct, location jump not 3 anymore
X A and S are registers that need to be hardcoded
- Values are in the files
- {"0","A"},{"1","X"},{"2","L"},{"2","B"},{"4","S"},{"5","T"},{"1","F"}
Format 3: to find B bits, address of current opcode - base
- For p bit: address of current operand - next location address in location counter
